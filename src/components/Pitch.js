        They are pretty. They feel good. They are the best. I buy them by the
        dozen and keep them in a dedicated travel safe. They are also the
        ultimate hedge against inflation, surpassing the enduring value of gold,
        the US dollar, and even Bitcoin. But seriously buy these and love them
        forever. And for heaven's sake, keep 'em dry!" -Elon Musk
